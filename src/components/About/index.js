      My Name is Tanner and I am currently 25 years old. Ever since i was a kid i've enjoyed learning about computers and playing games.
    As i turned towards coding it quickly became a passion. I have just completed a bootcamp through UTSA learning Full Stack Web Development. 
    I am very excited to find a job in the field as well as continue learning, and see where this new journey takes me.  </p>
